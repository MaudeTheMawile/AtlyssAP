# ATLYSS Archipelago

Archipelago randomizer implementation for ATLYSS. Enables multiworld randomizer gameplay with 137+ randomizable items, quest and level-based location checks, and configurable progression options.

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Archipelago
Download and install Archipelago 0.5.0 or later from the official Archipelago releases.

### Step 2: Install the World
Place `atlyss.apworld` in your Archipelago installation folder under `lib/worlds/` or `custom_worlds/`.

### Step 2.5: Generate Yaml
go to the Ap launcher and find "Generate Template Options" click to generate template options, then a yaml should be availble for you to use, 
you can edit the game options in "Options Creator" after making the edits to the game options, click export, you can find your yaml in the "Players" Folder

### Step 3: Install BepInEx
Download BepInEx 5.4.23.4 and extract it to your ATLYSS game directory. Run the game once to initialize BepInEx. 
(ignore step 3 if you are installing via thunderstore/r2modman as bepinex would be installed anyways)

### Step 4: Install the Mod
Place the DLL files from the `Plugin` folder into `ATLYSS/BepInEx/plugins/`. If installing via Thunderstore, the mod will be installed automatically.

### Step 5: Connect In-Game
Enter your server address, slot name, and password if required. Launch ATLYSS and press F5 to connect to your Archipelago server. 

## Configuration

The mod supports several gameplay options configurable through your Archipelago YAML:

**Goal Options:** Level-based progression (4, 8, 16, 24, or 32) or boss defeats (Colossus, Galius, Lord Kaluuz, or Valdur)

**Area Access:** Locked portals requiring items, fully unlocked areas, or progressive unlocking

**Shop Sanity:** Optional randomization of shop inventories
